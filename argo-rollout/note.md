Argo Rollouts Controller needs to know which Service is the canaryService and which is the stableService so it can update them to select their corresponding pods on the fly;
In order for us to know which pods are being selected by which service, we can specify a label or annotation to be attached to the Pods metadata via canaryMetadata and stableMetadata;
Argo Rollouts Controller also needs to know which Ingress is the stableIngress so it can create automatically the canary Ingress from it;
Finally, in order to avoid us from manually editing the Ingressâ€™s canary-weight annotation, the Argo Rollouts Controller will be able to do it for us automatically, thanks to the steps specification.
